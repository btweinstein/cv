  abstract = {Two surveys were administered to 39 people and demonstrated that perceptions
	of the odd sequence of pitches and irregular rhythms in a Thelonious
	Monk jazz piano improvisation matched impressions of Koehler's collection
	of irregularly arranged acute angles in his visual taketa figure
	and matched the verbal characterization of "angular." It was also
	found that perceptions of a legato melodic line in music by Ralph
	Vaughan Williams matched visual impressions of the smooth curves
	in Koehler's uluma figure and the verbal characterization of "rounded."
	The 18 listeners who said that they did not naturally visualize music
	made these matches just as often as the listeners who said they naturally
	visualized music. It was as though the music and the visual shapes
	possessed common structural properties.},
