@article{Weinstein_2010,
abstract = {Two surveys were administered to 39 people and demonstrated that perceptions of the odd sequence of pitches and irregular rhythms in a Thelonious Monk jazz piano improvisation matched impressions of Koehler's collection of irregularly arranged acute angles in his visual taketa figure and matched the verbal characterization of "angular." It was also found that perceptions of a legato melodic line in music by Ralph Vaughan Williams matched visual impressions of the smooth curves in Koehler's uluma figure and the verbal characterization of "rounded." The 18 listeners who said that they did not naturally visualize music made these matches just as often as the listeners who said they naturally visualized music. It was as though the music and the visual shapes possessed common structural properties.},
