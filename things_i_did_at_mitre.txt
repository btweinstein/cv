* Worked as part of CUIC: the Cross-Cutting Urgent Innovation Cell, focused on rapidly developing innovative solutions to whole-of-goverment National Security problems and presenting them to senior goverment stakeholders and delivering maximum impact
* Utilized PhD experience in modeling and simulation, stochastic processes, engineering, and data science to extract key insights from open-source (GOTS) goverment simulation tools and present them to senior goverment stakeholders
* Based on key insights, led teams to build prototypes that could help to solve goverment problems
