=== Bullets ===

* Rapidly developed innovative solutions to whole-of-goverment National Security problems utilizing modeling, simulation, data science, and protoptying skills developed during Physics PhD and Computational Science minor
* Presented results to senior goverment stakeholders across the DOD to deliver maximum impact
* Mentored 10s of staff and led small to lage teams to produce high quality and timely deliverables for goverment stakeholders (one of the first members of CUIC: Cross-Cutting Urgent Innovation Cell)
* Recognized as one of MITRE's most experienced AFSIM developers (popular GOTS M&S software); started MITRE's AFSIM usergroup 6 years ago that now has over 400 members, and developed widely used MITRE repositories
* Led over 2 million dollars in IR&D funding over 4 years to build a next-gen-C4 prototype that could be tested by real, simulated, or live data before deployment. Presented multiple times at MITRE R&T meetings (100's of goverment sponsors). Work is continuing under ACCEL C2 lab; asking for 8 million dollar investment in physical space from MITRE leadership.
