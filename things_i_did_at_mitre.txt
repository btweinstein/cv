* Led a team to design a next-gen c4 prototype that combines real / simulated data
	* Django, docker, microservice based architecture, rest APIs, redis, Kafka
* Created simulations & designed experiments to extract useful information for senior stakeholders and presented to them
* Led teams, small and large, younger and older, to execute critical tasks for senior goverment stakeholders
* Analyzed data from simulations and extracted visuals / lessons learned to teach goverment +
* Pioneered use of docker-based CI/CD pipelines for GOTS software 
* Member of CUIC: cross-cutting urgen innovation cell. Focused on speed of execution and delivery of the highest quality content to goverment stakeholders. Supposed to help cultural revolution in MITRE.
* Mentored staff
* Presented at key meetings showcasing MITRE's R&D program to hundreds of sponsors
* Led years of IR&D programs developing capabilities and new ideas focused on command and control

=== Bullets ===

* Rapidly developed innovative solutions to whole-of-goverment National Security problems utilizing modeling, simulation, data science, and protoptying skills developed during Physics PhD and Computational Science minor
* Presented results to senior goverment stakeholders across the DOD to deliver maximum impact
* Mentored 10s of staff and led small to lage teams to produce high quality and timely deliverables for goverment stakeholders (one of the first members of CUIC: Cross-Cutting Urgent Innovation Cell)
* Recognized as one of MITRE's most experienced AFSIM developers (popular GOTS M&S software); started MITRE's AFSIM usergroup 6 years ago that now has over 400 members, and developed widely used MITRE repositories
* Led over 2 million dollars in IR&D funding over 4 years to build a next-gen-C4 prototype that could be tested by real, simulated, or live data before deployment. Presented multiple times at MITRE R&T meetings (100's of goverment sponsors). Work is continuing under ACCEL C2 lab; asking for 8 million dollar investment in physical space from MITRE leadership.
